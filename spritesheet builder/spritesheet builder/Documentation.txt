This program takes mutipule .png files, sorts them by height, and saves
them as a .png file with an .xml file.
The .xml file stores the name of each sprite and the position of each sprite
in the sprite sheet.
The format of the sprite .xml file:
The root element is "SpriteSheet"
SpriteSheet has a FileName attribute which contains the filename
of the sprite sheet image.
The next element is "Sprite"
Each sprite element represents a sprite in the sprite sheet.
The sprite element contains a FileName attribute that represents the
filename of the sprite.
The sprite element also contains a "Rectanle" attribute that represents
the position of the sprite within the sprite sheet.
The value of the rectangle attribute is 4 numbers seperated by commas.
The 4 numbers represents: Xpos,Ypos,Width,Height

It also shows a preview of the sprite sheet before saving.
It properly handles tranparency in the sprites.

Features to add:
-support for larger sprite sheets
-more efficent sprite packing
